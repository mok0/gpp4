	* COPYING now contains LGPL version 2.1.

	* Modified configure.ac to use config/ as it's config
	directory. We don't want all those autotools scripts cluttering
	the top directory. Also doing more checks.

	* Removed lib/w32mvs.h since it does not appear to be used
	anywhere.

	* Imported source code branches from Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve
	and Paul Emsley into git repository.
