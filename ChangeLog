2010-01-25  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok0@ubuntu.com>

	* Merge patches to the library from ccp4-6.1.3; this concerns only 
	  two files: src/ccp4_program.h and src/cmtzlib.c.
	* Add configure macro gpp4.m4 to tarball.

2009-10-02  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok0@ubuntu.com>

	* Remove utils/* from the distribution; it is no longer
	required to split the fortran sources.

2009-09-23  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok0@ubuntu.com>

	* library_f.c, cmtzlib_f.c, ccp4_unitcell_f.c, csymslib_f.c,
	cmaplib_f.c: fixed various compilation warnings; mostly
	pointer casting.

2009-09-14  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@homunculus>

	* Add code for the FORTRAN API in src_f/. The additions have not
	been tested very much, but I did succeed in building refmac
	version 5.6.0031 with it, and it seems to run.

	* CCP4 uses fsplit to split the fortran source files, but I don't
	think that is necessary anymore, so the library is built from the
	original, unsplit files. Fsplit is in the bzr repo at the moment
	but will go when it is firmly established that it's not needed.

	* I removed some subroutines from the file modlib.f (EA06C, EA08C,
	EA09C, FA01BS, FA01CS, FA01DS, FA01AS and function FM02AD) because
	they carry a license that I know is completely unacceptable by
	Ubuntu or Debian, and probably Fedora too. Don't know about Fink.
	Basically you are required to notify Harwell in writing if you
	make modifications to the code, and only research institutions are
	allowed to do it. The license also carries something akin to an
	advertising clause *).

	The main routine is EA06C, and it is not used by very many
	programs. I grepped the CCP4 distro and found that only these
	programs are callers:

	scaleit.f, icoeff.f, makedict.f, geomcalc.f, scala.f

	EA06C is an eigenvalue finding subroutine, so it is easy to find
	replacements. I don't understand why CCP4 distributes this code at
	all.
	
2009-09-08  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok0@ubuntu.com>

	* Patches from Tim Fenn:
	  - src/ccp4_sysdep.h: Allow for compilation on ARM
	  - configure.ac: check for existence of sin() in libm
	  - gpp4.pc: use standard autoconf variables

2008-12-02  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.au.dk>

	* src/gpp4_open_symop_file.c: New file containing function
	open_symop_file which is special to gpp4.

	* Many changes in many files to facilitate merging of future
	  versions.

	* Merged in modifications from CCP4 library 6.1.0, since it is now
	  LGPL licensed.

2008-12-01  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.au.dk>

	* src/ccp4_sysdep.h: patch from Ubuntu to allow building on
	  the hppa and armel platforms

2007-10-21  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* gpp4.info.in: New conformant .info file from Bill Scott.

2007-10-20  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* test/Makefile.am: Variable $top_srcdir changed to $top_builddir
	  to allow linking with newly built shared library if building
	  with --prefix=blabla

2007-09-03  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Renamed directory lib -> src
	
	* src/ccp4_general.c (ccp4fyp): Modified strategy used when
	  searching for environ.def and default.def; also
	  $prefix/share/gpp4 and $prefix/lib/ are searched. (By default,
	  we install those files in $prefix/share/gpp4).

	* src/ccp4_general.c (ccp4fyp): Now guaranteed to use sensible
	  defaults if environmental variables CLIBD and CCP4_SCR are not
	  defined. In the first case, use our standard $prefix/share/gpp4
	  directory, in the second case, use /tmp.

	* src/csymlib.c (open_syminfo_file): memory leak fixed.

	* Bump version to 1.0.4, and release.
	
2007-09-02  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Wrote spec file to generate rpm packages.

	* Wrote info file to build fink packages under Mac OS X.
	
	* Use declarative rules to install pkgconfig data instead
	  of local install hooks.

2007-08-15  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Bumped version to 1.0.3
	
	* Added pkg-config module gpp4.pc
	
	* Under Linux it is necessary to specify libm when linking test
	program; this is not the case under Darwin.

	* Slight modification to configure.ac, so $prefix is set to
	something sensible in all cases (and not just "NONE").
	
2007-08-10  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Bump version to 1.0.2
	
	* lib/csymlib.c: Changed the way the library searches for
	syminfo.lib. The code is now in a static function
	open_syminfo_file(). This is to make the library more standalone
	and independent of the CCP4 distribution. The search strategy is
	to search the environmental variable SYMINFO first, then a number
	of standard locations in the file system, and finally the CCP4
	data directory.

	* lib/symlib.h: Added description of the FORTRAN API, which contains
	some more detail on the format of syminfo.lib.

	* Doxygen config file 'Doxyfile' has been moved to Doxyfile.in,
	and configure.ac now defines the software version in that file.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Banner modified to reflect gpp4 library version.

2007-08-09  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

        * Bump version to 1.0.1
	
	* lib/overview.h: Edit overview, project is no longer called
	'CINCH' but GPP4.

	* Removed lines INDEX_INFO::* sections from doxygen markup in all
	files.

	* Added Emacs local variables list to lib/*{c,h}
	
2007-07-25  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* lib/ccp4_unitcell.c: Reworked doxygen markup, moved from the
	header file to the C source file.

2007-07-24  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* lib/ccp4_types.h: Wrote doxygen markup.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c (symop_to_mat4_err): Internal function,
	declared static. Probably other functions should be made static,
	too. This is on the TODO list.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c: Doxygen markup reworked. I moved it from the
	header file, to the C source file, which is where the programmer
	most often will want to read the description. Merged descriptions
	of functions from comment in top of the file to the individual
	descriptions. Cleaned up comments everywhere, especially, I
	removed the ugly /*-----  */ delimiters.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Internal routines ccp4fyp_cleanup and
	ccp4setenv_cleanup declared static.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Doxygen markup reworked.

	* lib/ccp4_fortran.h: - ditto -

	* lib/ccp4_program.*: - ditto -

	* lib/library_f.h: Header file deleted, since it is not being used
	anywhere.

2007-07-19  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Removed files created in the build process from the git tree, since
	they only clutter the diffs and make it harder to see changes to the 
	source code.

	* Added .gitignore files in top directory, lib/ and data/
	
2007-07-04  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Replaced license text in all source files in lib with straight
	LGPL version 2.1 license text.

	* Removed ancient rcsid static variable. Since the code is not
	under RCS control, it is not updated anymore and therefore useless.
	
	* COPYING now contains LGPL version 2.1.

	* Modified configure.ac to use config/ as it's config
	directory. We don't want all those autotools scripts cluttering
	the top directory. Also doing more checks.

	* Removed lib/w32mvs.h since it does not appear to be used
	anywhere.

	* Imported source code branches from Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve
	and Paul Emsley into git repository.
