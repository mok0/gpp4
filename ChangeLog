	* lib/ccp4_unitcell.c: Reworked doxygen markup, moved from the
	header file to the C source file.

	* lib/ccp4_types.h: Wrote doxygen markup.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c (symop_to_mat4_err): Internal function,
	declared static. Probably other functions should be made static,
	too. This is on the TODO list.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c: Doxygen markup reworked. I moved it from the
	header file, to the C source file, which is where the programmer
	most often will want to read the description. Merged descriptions
	of functions from comment in top of the file to the individual
	descriptions. Cleaned up comments everywhere, especially, I
	removed the ugly /*-----  */ delimiters.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Internal routines ccp4fyp_cleanup and
	ccp4setenv_cleanup declared static.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Doxygen markup reworked.

	* lib/ccp4_fortran.h: - ditto -

	* lib/ccp4_program.*: - ditto -

	* Removed files created in the build process from the git tree, since
	they only clutter the diffs and make it harder to see changes to the 
	source code.

	* Added .gitignore files in top directory, lib/ and data/

	* Replaced license text in all source files in lib with straight
	LGPL version 2.1 license text.

	* Removed ancient rcsid static variable. Since the code is not
	under RCS control, it is not updated anymore and therefore useless.
	
	* COPYING now contains LGPL version 2.1.

	* Modified configure.ac to use config/ as it's config
	directory. We don't want all those autotools scripts cluttering
	the top directory. Also doing more checks.

	* Removed lib/w32mvs.h since it does not appear to be used
	anywhere.

	* Imported source code branches from Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve
	and Paul Emsley into git repository.
