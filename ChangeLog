	* src/ccp4_sysdep.h: patch from Ubuntu to allow building on
	  the hppa and armel platforms

2007-09-03  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Renamed directory lib -> src
	
	* src/ccp4_general.c (ccp4fyp): Modified strategy used when
	  searching for environ.def and default.def; also
	  $prefix/share/gpp4 and $prefix/lib/ are searched. (By default,
	  we install those files in $prefix/share/gpp4).

	* src/ccp4_general.c (ccp4fyp): Now guaranteed to use sensible
	  defaults if environmental variables CLIBD and CCP4_SCR are not
	  defined. In the first case, use our standard $prefix/share/gpp4
	  directory, in the second case, use /tmp.

	* src/csymlib.c (open_syminfo_file): memory leak fixed.

	* Bump version to 1.0.4, and release.
	
2007-09-02  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Wrote spec file to generate rpm packages.

	* Wrote info file to build fink packages under Mac OS X.
	
	* Use declarative rules to install pkgconfig data instead
	  of local install hooks.

2007-08-15  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Bumped version to 1.0.3
	
	* Added pkg-config module gpp4.pc
	
	* Under Linux it is necessary to specify libm when linking test
	program; this is not the case under Darwin.

	* Slight modification to configure.ac, so $prefix is set to
	something sensible in all cases (and not just "NONE").
	
2007-08-10  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Bump version to 1.0.2
	
	* lib/csymlib.c: Changed the way the library searches for
	syminfo.lib. The code is now in a static function
	open_syminfo_file(). This is to make the library more standalone
	and independent of the CCP4 distribution. The search strategy is
	to search the environmental variable SYMINFO first, then a number
	of standard locations in the file system, and finally the CCP4
	data directory.

	* lib/symlib.h: Added description of the FORTRAN API, which contains
	some more detail on the format of syminfo.lib.

	* Doxygen config file 'Doxyfile' has been moved to Doxyfile.in,
	and configure.ac now defines the software version in that file.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Banner modified to reflect gpp4 library version.

2007-08-09  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

        * Bump version to 1.0.1
	
	* lib/overview.h: Edit overview, project is no longer called
	'CINCH' but GPP4.

	* Removed lines INDEX_INFO::* sections from doxygen markup in all
	files.

	* Added Emacs local variables list to lib/*{c,h}
	
2007-07-25  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* lib/ccp4_unitcell.c: Reworked doxygen markup, moved from the
	header file to the C source file.

2007-07-24  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* lib/ccp4_types.h: Wrote doxygen markup.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c (symop_to_mat4_err): Internal function,
	declared static. Probably other functions should be made static,
	too. This is on the TODO list.

	* lib/ccp4_parser.c: Doxygen markup reworked. I moved it from the
	header file, to the C source file, which is where the programmer
	most often will want to read the description. Merged descriptions
	of functions from comment in top of the file to the individual
	descriptions. Cleaned up comments everywhere, especially, I
	removed the ugly /*-----  */ delimiters.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Internal routines ccp4fyp_cleanup and
	ccp4setenv_cleanup declared static.

	* lib/ccp4_general.c: Doxygen markup reworked.

	* lib/ccp4_fortran.h: - ditto -

	* lib/ccp4_program.*: - ditto -

	* lib/library_f.h: Header file deleted, since it is not being used
	anywhere.

2007-07-19  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Removed files created in the build process from the git tree, since
	they only clutter the diffs and make it harder to see changes to the 
	source code.

	* Added .gitignore files in top directory, lib/ and data/
	
2007-07-04  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@bioxray.dk>

	* Replaced license text in all source files in lib with straight
	LGPL version 2.1 license text.

	* Removed ancient rcsid static variable. Since the code is not
	under RCS control, it is not updated anymore and therefore useless.
	
	* COPYING now contains LGPL version 2.1.

	* Modified configure.ac to use config/ as it's config
	directory. We don't want all those autotools scripts cluttering
	the top directory. Also doing more checks.

	* Removed lib/w32mvs.h since it does not appear to be used
	anywhere.

	* Imported source code branches from Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve
	and Paul Emsley into git repository.
