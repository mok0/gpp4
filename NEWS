	* Because the library from CCP4 version 6.1.0 is again LGPL'ed
	  the (limited) changes from that version have been merged 
	  into gpp4 v. 1.1. The differences between gpp4 and the mother
	  library is mostly in the documentation and some parts that make
	  gpp4 standalone.

	* Version 1.0 of gpp4 now builds and installs correctly with the
	autotools. Now it's time for testing.
