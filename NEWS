	* Incorporate patches to the library from ccp4-6.1.3. This is a
	minor bug fix. Bump version to 1.2.1.

	* Version 1.2.0 of ggp4 released via launchpad.net The current
	version is on par with the CCP4 library version 6.1.2.

        The most important new feature is that gpp4 now supports the CCP4
	library's FORTRAN API. This means that the programs
	REFMAC (version 5.6.0031) and MOSFLM (version 7.0.6), both of
	which are distributed by their authors on an individual
	release-schedule, can be built with gpp4, without the need for
	downloading and installing the entire CCP4 suite (~230 Mb). The
	size of the gpp4 tarball is 686 Kb.

	The gpp4 library is available via the software repository
	mechanisms of some Linux distributions (Ubuntu and Fedora) and for
	OSX via Fink. The gpp4 library's FORTRAN API requires installation
	of Eugene Krissinel's mmdb library. On the aforementioned
	distributions this is installed automatically as a dependency.

	* Because the library from CCP4 version 6.1.0 is again LGPL'ed
	  the (limited) changes from that version have been merged into
	  gpp4 v. 1.1. The differences between gpp4 and the mother library
	  is mostly in the documentation and some parts that make gpp4
	  standalone.

	* Version 1.0 of gpp4 now builds and installs correctly with the
	autotools. Now it's time for testing.
