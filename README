This distribution is a special version of the CCP4 library, released
under the Lesser GNU Public License version 2.1.

The last version of the CCP4 library covered by a free license was
version 5.0.2. This version was patched by Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve to
address some of the more serious deficiencies of the older libraries.

It is the patched version of the CCP4 library that forms the basis for
this distribution, which includes a GNU autotools build environment
developed by Paul Emsley and Morten Kjeldgaard.

The reason for creating this public fork of the CCP4 libraries is that
several third party software distributions depend on the CCP4
libraries.

However, you cannot create a derived work containing both CCP4 6.*
licensed code and GPL'd code, and distribute the resulting program,
since the GPL demands that the derived work be distributed without
additional restirctions and the CCP4 6.* license imposes additional
restrictions on redistribution - in particular (but not limited to) an
indemnity clause.

The goal of this project -- named ggp4 to distinguish it from CCP4 --
is to provide a drop-in replacement for the non-free CCP4 libraries,
that as carefully as possible will implement the current CCP4 library
interface.
